    "## Summary: Agent Orchestration Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrated five key orchestration patterns using AGNO AI framework:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Single Agent**\n",
    "- Basic building block\n",
    "- Specialized expertise\n",
    "- Independent operation\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Sequential Orchestration**\n",
    "- Linear workflows\n",
    "- Each agent builds on previous work\n",
    "- Clear dependencies\n",
    "- Example: Venue \u2192 Speakers \u2192 Schedule\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Concurrent Orchestration**\n",
    "- Parallel execution\n",
    "- Independent tasks\n",
    "- Faster completion\n",
    "- Example: Marketing + Budget + Catering\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Group Chat**\n",
    "- Multi-agent discussion\n",
    "- Collaborative problem-solving\n",
    "- Diverse perspectives\n",
    "- Example: Tech + Experience + Risk teams\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Handoff Pattern**\n",
    "- Intelligent routing\n",
    "- Specialized handling\n",
    "- Efficient delegation\n",
    "- Example: Front desk \u2192 Specialists\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Magentic One**\n",
    "- Combined patterns\n",
    "- Complex workflows\n",
    "- Adaptive responses\n",
    "- Example: Emergency response system\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Benefits of Agent Orchestration\n",
    "\n",
    "\u2705 **Scalability** - Handle complex tasks by breaking them down  \n",
    "\u2705 **Efficiency** - Parallel execution and specialized expertise  \n",
    "\u2705 **Robustness** - Multiple agents provide redundancy and validation  \n",
    "\u2705 **Flexibility** - Adapt workflows based on task requirements  \n",
    "\u2705 **Maintainability** - Modular design with clear responsibilities  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Real-World Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "These patterns enable sophisticated conference management automation:\n",
    "- **Planning** - Coordinated multi-team setup\n",
    "- **Operations** - Real-time support and problem-solving\n",
    "- **Crisis Management** - Rapid coordinated response\n",
    "- **Analytics** - Multi-perspective evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next Steps:**\n",
    "- Experiment with different agent configurations\n",
    "- Combine patterns for your specific use cases\n",
    "- Explore AGNO AI advanced features\n",
    "- Build production-ready agent systems"
